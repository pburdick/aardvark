The Aardvark controller is an Arduino compatible board that is based around the powerful ATMega1284P* microcontroller. Built in to the board are:

(2) LM2675 switching power supplies for the 5v supply and a 6v supply for servos
(1) L6255 dual full bridge motor driver
(1) MXC6255XU accelerometer
(1) MCP79411 real-time clock
(1) TCS3200 color sensor
(1) CAT24M01 128KB EEPROM
(2) AD8211 current monitors for the DC motors
(1) DS1775 temperature sensor
(1) MCP23017 I/O expander with 8 bits available
(1) LTC4365 overvoltage, undervoltage and reverse supply protection
(1) FT232R USB to serial UART
(1) Xbee radio with level converter and MIC5255 3.3v regulator
(1) Battery monitor with overvoltage protection
(2) Servo drivers
(10) I/O connectors, including 5 analog
(2) Programmable LEDs
(1) Piezo speaker

The Aardvark library enables the developer to easily write code for Aardvark without having an in-depth knowledge of each of these devices.
